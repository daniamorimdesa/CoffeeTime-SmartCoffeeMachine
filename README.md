# Coffee Time - Smart Coffee Machine â˜• 
**_Final Project â€“ EmbarcaTech Program_**  

## About the Project
Coffee Time is a smart coffee machine developed as the final project for the EmbarcaTech course, simulating personalized coffee preparation with adjustable strength, temperature, and quantity. The system integrates sensors and actuators for monitoring and control, fully simulated on the Wokwi platform.

## What is EmbarcaTech? 
**EmbarcaTech** is a professional training program aimed at university students in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and related areas, focusing on **Embedded Systems and Internet of Things (IoT)**. The program consists of two phases:

1. **Online Training (3 months)** â€“ Covers concepts and practical development in embedded systems.
2. **Technology Residency (12 months)** â€“ Practical application of knowledge in case studies and projects in fields such as education, security, industry, and healthcare.
   
This project is part of the first phase of the program, serving as a practical example of IoT-based automation.
