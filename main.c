/* Coffee Time - Smart Coffee Machine with Raspberry Pi Pico W. 
This IoT project automates personalized coffee preparation, integrating
sensors and actuators for real-time monitoring and control.
Fully simulated on the Wokwi platform, it was developed as the final 
project of the EmbarcaTech program.
